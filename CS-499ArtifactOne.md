# CS-499 Enhanced Artifact One Narrative

## Software Design & Engineering Artifact: Description
As mentioned in Module One’s ePortfolio Selection and Refinement Plan assignment, this was an artifact I was working on while taking CS-330: Computational Graphic and Visualization. The artifact in question was a 3D object designed and rendered by way of Modern OpenGL alongside the FreeGLUT and GLUT application programming interfaces.

## Software Design & Engineering Artifact: Inclusion in ePortfolio
I chose this item in specific because it demonstrated my understanding of software design and engineering principles. Beyond that, the artifact showcases a fundamental understanding of computer-aided design for the creation and modification of a given design, along with the tools used for doing so (i.e., Auto Desk Maya). My artifact has included implementation of orthographic projection and zoom for better viewing of the object. Other enhancements include keyboard functionality wherein the user can manipulate the camera via the designated keys, improved textures and ambient lighting, along with refined object dimensions, diffused lighting, etc.  

## Software Design & Engineering Artifact: Updates & Course Objectives
I felt confident that I met all of the course objectives I planned to meet with the enhancements outlined in Module One. I chose the enhancements that I would make in accordance with the course objectives themselves, so there wasn’t very much issue in this regard. As for any updates that I have in mind with relation to my outcome-coverage plans, I could only think of the software security portion. The enhancements I’ve made on the artifact are extensive and thorough.

## Software Design & Engineering Artifact: Reflection on Enhancements Made
While working on enhancements, I was faced with a wide-assortment of challenges: including a SOIL image loader, ensuring that lighting was sufficient and appropriately reflected on the object, ensuring that the object had appropriate shaders applied, and there was appropriate specular light.
