# CS-499 Artifact Selection & ePortfolio Refinement Plan

## Category One: Software Engineering/Design
For the purposes of this category, I am considering choosing an artifact that I worked on while taking CS-330: Computational Graphics and Visualization wherein I designed and rendered a 3D object by way of modern OpenGL in conjunction with the FreeGLUT and GLUT APIs. My plan for enhancing this particular artifact centers around three primary aspects: use of appropriate shaders, textures, and improved prospective projection. Iâ€™m also hoping to limit the number of triangles used to only 1,000. Doing so will help demonstrate my abilities in (and understanding of) software design and engineering principles.  

## Category Two: Algorithms and Data Structures
For the purposes of this category, I am considering choosing an artifact that I worked on while taking CS-260: Data Structures and Algorithms wherein I implemented a hash table with chaining for a program that would allow users to input their bids. Here, the chaining technique was used to prevent collisions from occurring in the hash tables. My enhancement plan is primarily revolving around improving the efficiency and performance of the program by remediating any possible collisions within the hash tables. Doing so will help demonstrate my abilities in (and understanding of) data structure implementation, data management, and data organization.

## Category Three: Databases
For the purposes of this category, I will likely use an artifact from CS-340 wherein I utilized the RESTful API web-based protocol in conjunction with (MongoDB document-storage system) to create a reporting service for basic stock market securities information. My enhancement plan will likely include the following: functionality for document retrieval, document manipulation, and additional code to handle a GET request from a server for retrieval of data. Doing so will demonstrate my abilities in (and understanding of) database design, database implementation, and API calls to make reusable software services - while also employing industry-standard best practices.

## ePortfolio Overall
During the code review, my objectives will be to relay information about the following: purpose of the code, code structure, bugs or underlying issues, and finally explain enhancements made to the code. In the narratives section, my objective will be to illustrate information with regards to the following: what the artifact is, when it was made, why I chose this artifact(s) in specific, and go into further detail about the enhancement process. In the self-assessment portion, I will elaborate further on my experience within the CS program and skills gained throughout.
