# CS-499 Enhanced Artifact Three Narrative

## Databases Artifact: Description
And though I’ve described this previously in Module One’s ePortfolio Selection and Refinement Plan, this was an artifact that I worked on during my time in CS-340: Client & Server-Side Development. The artifact itself was a rudimentary reporting service designed for stock market securities information; the reporting service uses a RESTful API web-based protocol and MongoDB – a very popular document-storage system that utilizes JSON.

## Databases Artifact: Inclusion in ePortfolio
The artifact demonstrates that I have a foundational understanding of cross-platform, document-oriented database programs and how to use them with optimal effect. It also shows a level of proficiency with relation to building RESTful web services via NoSQL database programs. Furthermore, it demonstrates my capabilities in the design and implementation of databases, along with appropriate use of API calls to build reusable and sustainable software.  My databases artifact has included functionality that enables CRUD operations on database documents; functionality that facilitates retrieving individual and multiple documents; along with functionality that enables retrieval of data from a server via GET HTTP requests.

## Databases Artifact: Updates & Course Objectives
As far as course objectives are concerned, I felt fairly confident that I met all the objectives I planned to meet with the enhancements made on this artifact. It was the same approach I took on the previous artifacts: choose enhancements that align well with the primary objectives. The only pending updates thus far (if applicable) would be related to the security section.  

## Databases Artifact: Reflections on Enhancements Made
While working, I faced two primary challenges: scripts written in Python refusing to run in the Codio platform, and several HTTP status codes indicating errors - all else went relatively fine.
