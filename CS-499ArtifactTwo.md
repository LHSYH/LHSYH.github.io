# CS-499 Enhanced Artifact Two Narrative 

## Algorithms & Data Structures Artifact: Description
As it was mentioned in Module One’s ePortfolio Selection and Refinement Plan assignment, this was an artifact I worked on while taking CS-260: Data Structures & Algorithms. The artifact is a program that utilizes a hash table and appropriate hash chaining techniques for a bidding system. 

## Algorithms & Data Structures Artifact: Inclusion in ePortoflio
I’ve chosen to include this artifact in specific because it demonstrates that I have a fundamental understanding of data structures and algorithms (i.e., how, when, and why to implement one algorithm or data structure over another), data organization, and effective data management. The artifact also showcases my ability for modular coding and good code organization. Code modularity enables far more maintainable code given the fact that methods and functions in the program can be reused without having to go through the trouble of rewriting them (Harvie, 2018). Beyond that, the artifact was improved in a number of ways, some of which I’ve outlined in my Module Four Journal assignment: refined and enhanced chaining techniques, improved collision prevention and resolution measures, an exponential increase in buckets for the hash tables, and thereby an overall improvement in terms of efficiency. 

## Algorithms & Data Structures Artifact: Updates & Course Objectives
I feel confident in saying that I’ve met all course objectives I planned to meet, in accordance with Module One’s enhancement outline. I had a plan of action that would facilitate the refinement process, and from there, it was just a matter of seeing it through. As of this moment, I do not have any further updates to my outcome-coverage plans other than the security section.

## Algorithms & Data Structures: Reflections on Enhancements Made
There weren’t very many challenges I faced during the enhancement process for this particular artifact. Perhaps the only challenge would be implementing logic that would display bids made.
